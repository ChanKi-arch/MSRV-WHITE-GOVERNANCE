# FAQ (Public Demo)

### Q: Is the proprietary MSR-V core engine included in this repository?
**A:** No. This repository provides an **IP-safe public demo** for validating governance behavior.  
**The proprietary core engine is intentionally excluded to protect intellectual property.**

---

### Q: Is MSR-V a language model?
**A:** No. MSR-V does not generate text. It is a **deterministic governance layer** that controls reasoning execution depth.

---

### Q: Is MSR-V a fact-checker?
**A:** No. MSR-V does not judge factual truth.  
It detects **structural defects** and governs routing decisions.

---

### Q: What does "Fracture" mean?
**A:** Fracture indicates a **structural defect** (e.g., parsing failure, missing essential slots, unstable structural signals).  
It does NOT mean "factually false".

---

### Q: Why does routing differ between Korean and English?
**A:** Korean (agglutinative) often enables safer shallow passes (higher BYPASS).  
English (inflectional) tends to require more structural verification (higher LITE/FULL).  
This reflects linguistic structure, not model bias.

### Q: What do Zs and Theta represent?
**A:** They are **internal governance signals**:
- **Zs**: structural stability index
- **Theta (θ)**: internal tension / torsion index  
They are not probability-based confidence scores.
